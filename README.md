# Kuka-YouBot
By: Dan Stoianovici & Troy Southard @ the University of Denver

A pick and place project with the Kuka YouBot educational platform with positioning data from a Vicon Tracker System using ROS. 


In order to use the system a YouBot Driver must be installed on the YouBots internal computer.

Vicon Data Stream SDK is installed on the computer running the Vicon System to broadcast the positioning data to the LAN.

In order to pull data from the Vicon DataStream, vicon_bridge is installed and run as a ROS node.
